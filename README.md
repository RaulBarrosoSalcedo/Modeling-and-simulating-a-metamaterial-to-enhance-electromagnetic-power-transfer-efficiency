This is the repository of the codes related to the IEEE Latam Journal Publication entitled " Modeling and simulating a metamaterial to enhance electromagnetic power transfer efficiency"


File named "Epsilonrcalculation.aedt" in HFSS format can be utilized to estimate the value of epsilon in presence of lossless materials in the squeme of the Fig. 6.a. The existent capacitance Cm between the PEC surfaces must be calculated in presence of the conductor cube of edge "b". Then, the existent capacitance C0 between the PEC surfaces must be calculated in absence of the conductor cube. Finally, the relative epsilon er is estimated as the ratio er = Cm/C0. Hence, Fig. 7 can be constructed variating the ratio b/a for each calculation.

File named "Murcalculation.aedt" in HFSS format can be utilized to estimate the value of mu in presence of lossless materials in a squeme that is equivalent of the Fig. 6.b. For the simulations, such squeme was calculated with an electric field instead a magentic field, but with a perfect magnetic cube conductor in the cell that yields to the same border conditions for E that the electric perfect conductor cube produces for H. The existent capacitance Cm´ between the PEC surfaces must be calculated in presence of the PMC cube of edge "b". Then, the existent capacitance C0´ between the PEC surfaces must be calculated in absence of the PMC conductor cube. Finally, the relative mu given by mur is estimated as the ratio mur = Cm´/C0´. Hence, Fig. 8 can be constructed variating the ratio b/a for each calculation.
